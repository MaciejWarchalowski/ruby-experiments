## Lexing
Ruby doesnâ€™t use Lex, which is usually used together with something like Yacc or Bison.  Ruby core team opted to write custom tokenization code by hand. [`parser_yylex`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v2_5_3/parse.y#L8261) in `parse.y` is responsible for tokenizing source code of the ruby script.
